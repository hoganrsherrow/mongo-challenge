## Installation
Clone the Github Repository and run npm install to download Mongoose and express to the local directory. Be sure to set up a ```.env.``` file to hold your MongoDB credentials.

## Usage
This backend can be used in conjunction with a custom frontend to build a socail media experience. In its current state, it will need to be interacted with through a routing platform such as Insomnia until it has a frontend to interact with.
